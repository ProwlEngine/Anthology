# Anthology

The collection of modular libraries that power the [Prowl game engine](https://github.com/ProwlEngine/Prowl).

Each library ships as its own `Prowl.*` NuGet package and can be used independently, but
they live and version together in this one repository so that a change spanning several of
them lands in a single commit, no cross-repo version juggling, no publish chain.

## Versioning

The whole family ships under one version, set once in [`Directory.Build.props`](Directory.Build.props).
Bump that single `<Version>` and tag the commit `vX.Y.Z`; CI builds, packs and pushes every
package at that version.

## Repository layout

Every library is a self-contained folder. Shared build and packaging rules live in the
root `Directory.Build.props`, so individual project files stay small.

History for each library is preserved under its folder, so `git log -- Scribe/` shows the
full past of that library.
