/** A module is the granularity of shader code compilation and loading.

In most cases a module corresponds to a single compile "translation unit."
This will often be a single `.slang` or `.hlsl` file and everything it
`#include`s.

Notably, a module `M` does *not* include the things it `import`s, as these
as distinct modules that `M` depends on. There is a directed graph of
module dependencies, and all modules in the graph must belong to the
same session (`ISession`).

A module establishes a namespace for looking up types, functions, etc.
