# ShaderDef Shader Markup Specification

Graphite uses a ShaderLab-inspired declarative render state markup language known as ShaderDef
If that was a mouthful, it is a text description of how your CPU should set up your GPU to draw a shader.
It uses GLSL shaders in conjunction with a custom ShaderLab-adjacent syntax to describe GPU render state, shader variants, and the programs to use.

---

## Properties Block

The `Properties` block declares named default parameters that can be set on a material at runtime.

Graphite parses and stores these on `ShaderDefinition.Properties` but does not use them itself. They
exist for engine-side consumers such as a material inspector.

```
Properties
{
    PropertyName("Display Name", Type) = DefaultValue
    ...
}
```

The default value is optional. If omitted, the property is zero-initialized.

### Property Types

| Type                 | Default Value Syntax              | Description                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Integer`            | `= 1`                             | 32-bit integer (stored as float)     |
| `Float`              | `= 0.5`                           | 32-bit floating-point scalar         |
| `Vector`             | `= (x, y, z, w)`                  | Four-component floating-point vector |
| `Color`              | `= (r, g, b, a)`                  | Four-component color (same as Vector)|
| `Matrix`             | `= ((row0)(row1)(row2)(row3))`    | 4×4 floating-point matrix            |
| `Texture2D`          | `= "name" {}`                     | 2D texture; `name` is a built-in default (e.g. `"red"`, `""`) |
| `Texture2DArray`     | `= "name" {}`                     | Array of 2D textures                 |
| `Texture3D`          | `= "name" {}`                     | 3D volume texture                    |
| `TextureCubemap`     | `= "name" {}`                     | Cubemap texture                      |
| `TextureCubemapArray`| `= "name" {}`                     | Array of cubemap textures            |

### Example

```
Properties
{
    _Color("Tint Color", Color) = (1, 1, 1, 1)
    _Roughness("Roughness", Float) = 0.5
    _Count("Sample Count", Integer) = 4
    _Offset("UV Offset", Vector) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    _AlbedoMap("Albedo", Texture2D) = "" {}
    _Cubemap("Environment", TextureCubemap) = "" {}
}
```

### Attributes

Attributes follow the default value, each in brackets: `[Name]` or `[Name(arg, arg)]`. Arguments are numbers,
identifiers or quoted strings. ShaderDef keeps each as text; the meanings below are what Graphite's renderer and the
inspectors built on it read.

| Attribute              | On                 | Meaning                                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Gamma`                | `Color`            | The value is entered in gamma space and stored linear                  |
| `Range(min, max)`      | `Float`, `Integer` | Shown as a slider between the bounds                                   |
| `Keyword(AXIS)`        | textures           | The material toggle `AXIS` is on while a texture is set                |
| `Toggle(AXIS)`         | `Float`, `Integer` | The material toggle `AXIS` is on while the value is not zero, or any of them when several drive it |
| `TwoSided`             | `Float`, `Integer` | With `Toggle(AXIS)`: while that toggle is on the material draws both sides whatever its culling, back faces with the normal flipped |
| `Transmissive`         | `Float`, `Integer` | With `Toggle(AXIS)`: while that toggle is on the material draws as transparent whatever its surface, through its `Transmission` pass in place of `Forward`, and unless it also draws two sided, through its `BackDepth` pass before the transparent surfaces |
| `KeywordEnum(AXIS)`    | `Integer`          | The material axis `AXIS` takes the value at the integer's index        |
| `Enum(A, B, C)`        | `Integer`          | Shown as a dropdown of the names, stored as their index                |
| `Header("Text")`       | any                | A heading drawn above the property                                     |
| `Space`                | any                | A gap drawn above the property                                         |
| `ShowIf(AXIS)`         | any                | Shown only while the toggle `AXIS` is on; `ShowIf(AXIS, VALUE)` for an enum axis |
| `HideInInspector`      | any                | Not shown                                                              |
| `NoScaleOffset`        | textures           | No per texture scale and offset shown                                  |
| `Normal`               | textures           | Expects a tangent space normal map                                     |
| `HDR`                  | `Color`            | The colour may exceed 1                                                |
| `Map`                  | `Texture2D`        | A packed map: 28 bytes holding the texture, sampler, channel, UV set, scale offset and rotation, read as `X`, `X_ST`, `X_Rotation`, `X_Channel`, `X_UV` and `X_Present`. The record gets a mask word after the properties for `X_Present` |

A material that sets an axis explicitly overrides what its properties drive.

## Surface Block

The quickest way to a custom lit or unlit shader. `Surface "Lit"` or `Surface "Unlit"` gives the shader Graphite's
standard Forward, Prepass, ShadowCaster and Debug passes with every feature of Graphite/Lit or Graphite/Unlit: shadows,
lightmaps, probes, decals, fog, surface types and their properties. The shader's own `Properties` are added to the
standard ones, replacing any of the same name.

Graphite/Lit is OpenPBR Surface v1.1.1. Its properties are the spec's parameters under their spec names, such as
`base_color`, `specular_roughness` and `coat_weight`, and engine extensions under plain names: `ambient_occlusion`,
`ambient_occlusion_map_strength`, `normal_scale`, `coat_normal_scale`, `height_scale`, `tangent_rotation` and `alpha_cutoff`. Every texturable input `X` has a map
`X_map`, and `geometry_normal_map`, `geometry_coat_normal_map` and `geometry_tangent_map` feed the frame. The input is `X` times
its map wherever the map is set, with the occlusion map first blended from white by `ambient_occlusion_map_strength`. A map's channel, UV set, scale and offset are part of its texture value, set with
`Material.SetTextureChannel`, `SetTextureUVSet` and `SetTextureScaleOffset`. Transparent PBR surfaces write
premultiplied colour with `geometry_opacity` as coverage. Its Forward, Transmission and Debug passes are tagged
`"Output" = "Premultiplied"`, so `SurfaceSettings` blends them with premultiplied factors whichever `SurfaceBlend` is set:
Alpha and Premultiplied as One, InverseSourceAlpha, Additive as One, One.

Graphite/Unlit emits light like Lit's emission: `base_color` times its map and the vertex colour, at
`emission_luminance` nits, 20000 by default, white at EV100 14, times the view's exposure. It follows exposure as everything lit does, so a
reflection probe captured at any EV100 shows it as the view does. Something that must keep its colour on screen
whatever the exposure, such as a HUD drawn in the scene, sets `emission_luminance` to one over the view's exposure.

The coat, fuzz, thin film and anisotropy are material toggles of the Forward and Debug passes, `PBR_COAT`, `PBR_FUZZ`,
`PBR_THIN_FILM` and `PBR_ANISOTROPY`, each on while `coat_weight`, `fuzz_weight`, `thin_film_weight` or either roughness
anisotropy is not zero, so surfaces without them pay nothing. A Surface function that raises one of those from zero
needs its material to turn the toggle on with `Material.Set(axis, true)`. The global `PBR_TIER` LITE drops the thin film
and anisotropy and lights the coat and fuzz from probes and ambient light only.

`PBR_PARALLAX` follows `height_scale`, off at its default of zero. While it is on, `geometry_height_map` (white at the
surface, black `height_scale` below it, in the map's own texture units) moves both UV sets of every pass before any map
is read, by parallax occlusion mapping along the view ray, so every map, the Surface function's `uv` and `uv1`, and the
cutout of the depth passes follow the relief. LITE views take a single offset instead, except for cutout surfaces, whose
alpha test must match their depth passes. It needs the mesh's tangents.

`PBR_TRANSMISSION` follows `transmission_weight` (`[Transmissive]`). It is declared by the Debug pass, and the
Transmission pass defines it: that pass refracts the view's opaque colour behind the surface through the volume whose
far side the BackDepth pass draws, and is tagged `"ReadsWhen" = "PBR_TIER FULL"`, so LITE views copy nothing and
refract the probes instead. See `Graphite/PBR/Transmission.glsl`.

The optional GLSLPROGRAM block holds fragment code defining the model's Surface function, which may change the inputs
before the surface is lit. Decals land after it, over the inputs it made. Its second argument is read only: `uv`, `uv1`, `vertexColor`, `relativePos`, `viewDir` and
`geometryNormal`, `tangent` and `bitangent`. `vertexColor` is the vertex colour times the object's colour,
`RenderableDesc.Color` or `DrawItem.Color`, white unless the host sets one, so instances drawn with a colour each tint
the standard surfaces' base colour and coverage. `Custom0` and `Custom1` stay free for the host's own shaders.

- PBR: `void Surface(inout PBR_Params p, Graphite_SurfaceData i)`. `PBR_Params` holds every spec parameter in camel
  case, `baseColor` for `base_color`, with `geometryNormal` in world space and `occlusion` for `ambient_occlusion`.
- Unlit: `void Surface(inout Unlit_Params p, Graphite_SurfaceData i)` over `baseColor`, `emissionLuminance` and `alpha`.

The depth passes run it only for cutout surfaces, with the UVs, vertex colour and relative position filled in, so a
cutout driven by any of them cuts shadows and depth the same. Their `viewDir` points toward the depth pass's own camera,
a light's for shadows, and their normals keep defaults, unless `PBR_PARALLAX` needs the frame.

Positions in Graphite shaders are relative: world space moved so the camera sits at the origin, which keeps the
precision of objects far from it. World means true world space. `Graphite_RelativeToWorld(i.relativePos)` gives the
world position, for effects fixed to the world such as a dissolve. Directions and normals are world space, as moving the
origin changes none of them.

A tangent space normal map, such as a detail map, goes through `Graphite_SurfaceNormalMap(i, texel, scale)`, which
places it on the mesh's frame and returns a world normal. `Graphite_StandardNormalMap(texel, normal, tangent, bitangent,
scale)` takes any frame, for blending onto `p.geometryNormal` or for triplanar mapping.

```
Shader "MyGame/Rim"
{
    Properties
    {
        _RimColor("Rim Color", Color) = (0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0)
        _RimPower("Rim Power", Float) = 3.0
    }

    Surface "Lit"
    {
        GLSLPROGRAM
        uniform vec4 _RimColor;
        uniform float _RimPower;

        void Surface(inout PBR_Params p, Graphite_SurfaceData i)
        {
            float rim = 1.0 - max(dot(p.geometryNormal, i.viewDir), 0.0);
            p.emissionColor = _RimColor.rgb;
            p.emissionLuminance = 500.0 * pow(rim, _RimPower);
        }
        ENDGLSL
    }
}
```

An optional `Vertex` block moves vertices for wind, waves and wobble. It defines
`void SurfaceVertex(inout Graphite_SurfaceVertex v)` over the object space `position`, `normal`, `tangent` (w the
handedness), `color`, `uv` and `uv1`, run before the vertex is transformed in every pass, so shadows and depth match.
Animate with `v.time` rather than the view's time: the forward pass runs the function again at last frame's time to find
where the vertex was, which keeps motion vectors, TAA and motion blur right.

```
Surface "Lit"
{
    Vertex
    {
        GLSLPROGRAM
        uniform float _WaveHeight;

        void SurfaceVertex(inout Graphite_SurfaceVertex v)
        {
            v.position += v.normal * sin(v.position.x * 2.0 + v.time) * _WaveHeight;
        }
        ENDGLSL
    }
}
```

A surface model marks where this goes with a `#pragma surface_vertex` line in each pass's Vertex section, before
Graphite/Standard/StandardVertex.glsl is included.

An optional `Lighting` block replaces how the surface is lit, for toon ramps and other custom shading. It defines
either function below or both, over the closure Graphite/PBR/Closure.glsl prepares once per pixel:

- `vec3 Graphite_BRDF(PBR_Closure c, Graphite_LightContribution l)`, which every light goes through. It may call
  `PBR_EvaluateLight(c, l)`, or `PBR_EvaluateDiffuse(c, L)` and `PBR_EvaluateSpecular(c, L)` for each lobe.
- `vec3 Graphite_AmbientBRDF(PBR_Closure c, PBR_Indirect i)`, which ambient light goes through: `i.irradiance` is the
  diffuse light over pi from the lightmap, probes or sky, `i.specular` the base lobe's probe radiance, both with
  occlusion applied. The default, `PBR_EvaluateAmbient(c, i)`, returns
  `c.diffuseAlbedo * i.irradiance + c.specularAlbedo * i.specular`, and a toon surface can band or tint its shadow
  side here.

Only the lit passes take it, Forward and Debug for `Surface "Lit"`, so decals and every surface type keep working.
`Surface "Unlit"` has no lights and refuses one. Its uniforms may repeat the surface code's, as every material uniform
is a property.

```
Surface "Lit"
{
    Lighting
    {
        GLSLPROGRAM
        vec3 Graphite_BRDF(PBR_Closure c, Graphite_LightContribution l)
        {
            float ramp = step(0.5, dot(c.normal, l.diffuseL) * 0.5 + 0.5);
            return c.diffuseAlbedo * ramp * l.diffuse * l.radiance;
        }
        ENDGLSL
    }
}
```

A surface model marks where this goes with a `#pragma surface_lighting` line in a pass's Shared section, before
its model file, such as Graphite/Standard/PBRSurface.glsl, is included.

Further `Pass` blocks may follow, such as a pass of a type a render feature draws.

---

## Pass Block

```
Pass [index]
{
    Name "PassName"         // optional
    Tags { ... }            // optional

    // Render state commands (zero or more, any order)
    ZTest LessEqual
    ZWrite On
    Cull Back
    ...

    Stencil { ... }         // optional

    GLSLPROGRAM
    ...                     // embedded GLSL sections
    ENDGLSL
}
```

The optional integer `index` after `Pass` identifies the pass for multi-pass selection.

### Name

```
Name "ShadowCaster"
```

Assigns a human-readable name to the pass. Used for pass lookup and debugging.

### Tags

```
Tags { "LightMode" = "ForwardBase"  "Queue" = "Transparent" }
```

Arbitrary key-value string pairs associated with the pass. Tags are consumed by the library or
render pipeline; the shader system stores them but does not interpret them. Graphite's renderer reads these:

| Tag            | Values                                                        | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LightMode`    | `Prepass`, `Forward`, `ShadowCaster`, `ObjectId`, `Sky`, `Transmission`, `BackDepth`, any other name a feature draws | The pass type the renderer draws the pass as. `Transmission` replaces `Forward` for transmissive materials, `BackDepth` draws their back faces' distance along the view ray, culling front faces, unblended. `ShadowCaster` draws every material casting shadows, transparent ones included, unblended with depth written; one that lets light through discards fragments to cast a partial shadow |
| `RenderQueue`  | an integer, 2500 and up transparent                           | The default render queue of the shader's materials                      |
| `SceneColor`   | `Read`                                                        | The pass samples the view's opaque colour through `Graphite/SceneColor.glsl`. A view whose transparent list holds such a pass copies its colour after the opaque surfaces and the sky, with mips, before drawing its transparent surfaces |
| `SceneDepth`   | `Read`                                                        | The pass fetches the view's opaque depth through `Graphite/SceneDepth.glsl`. A view whose transparent list holds such a pass copies its depth after the opaque surfaces before drawing its transparent surfaces |
| `BackDepth`    | `Read`                                                        | The pass fetches the view's back depth, which `TransmissionDepthFeature` draws from the `BackDepth` passes of the view's transmissive volumes after the opaque surfaces |
| `ReadsWhen`    | `AXIS VALUE`, a global axis and one of its values             | The pass's `SceneColor`, `SceneDepth` and `BackDepth` reads count only in views at that value, a view without the axis set taking its first |

---

## Render State Commands

All render state commands are optional. Unspecified fields fall back to the library defaults listed
below.

### Culling

```
Cull Back | Front | Off
```

Controls which polygon faces are discarded before rasterization.

| Value   | Description                          | Default |
|---------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `Back`  | Cull back-facing polygons            | ✓       |
| `Front` | Cull front-facing polygons           |         |
| `Off`   | Disable face culling (double-sided)  |         |

---

### Depth Test — `ZTest`

```
ZTest Disabled | Never | Less | Equal | LessEqual | Greater | NotEqual | GreaterEqual | Always
```

Sets the depth comparison function. `Disabled` turns depth testing off entirely; any other value enables depth testing and sets the comparison function.

| Value          | Description                                          | Default |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `Disabled`     | Depth testing is turned off entirely                 |         |
| `Never`        | Never passes                                         |         |
| `Less`         | Passes if fragment depth < stored depth              |         |
| `Equal`        | Passes if fragment depth = stored depth              |         |
| `LessEqual`    | Passes if fragment depth <= stored depth             | ✓       |
| `Greater`      | Passes if fragment depth > stored depth              |         |
| `NotEqual`     | Passes if fragment depth != stored depth             |         |
| `GreaterEqual` | Passes if fragment depth >= stored depth             |         |
| `Always`       | Always passes (depth test is effectively skipped)    |         |

---

### Depth Write — `ZWrite`

```
ZWrite On | Off
```

Controls whether passing fragments write their depth value to the depth buffer.

| Value | Description                   | Default |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------|
| `On`  | Write depth to depth buffer   | ✓       |
| `Off` | Do not write depth            |         |

---

### Depth Clamp — `ZClip`

```
ZClip On | Off
```

Controls depth clamping. When `Off`, fragments outside the near/far clip planes are clamped to
the depth range rather than clipped. Equivalent to OpenGL's `GL_DEPTH_CLAMP`.

| Value | Description                                      | Default |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `On`  | Standard depth clipping (no clamping)            | ✓       |
| `Off` | Enable depth clamping — clip planes not enforced |         |

---

### Blending — `Blend`, `BlendRGB`, `BlendAlpha`

```
Blend    <SrcFactor> <DstFactor>
BlendRGB <SrcFactor> <DstFactor>
BlendAlpha <SrcFactor> <DstFactor>
```

- `Blend` — sets the same source and destination blend factors for both RGB and alpha channels.
- `BlendRGB` — sets factors for the RGB channels only.
- `BlendAlpha` — sets factors for the alpha channel only.

Specifying any `Blend` command implicitly enables blending for the pass.

#### Blend Factors

| Value                   | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

### Blend Equation — `BlendOp`

```
BlendOp Add | Subtract | ReverseSubtract | Minimum | Maximum
```

Sets the equation used to combine source and destination color values after applying blend factors.
Applies to both RGB and alpha channels.

| Value             | Formula                     | Description                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Add`             | `Src + Dst`                 | Default additive blend             |
| `Subtract`        | `Src - Dst`                 | Subtracts destination from source  |
| `ReverseSubtract` | `Dst - Src`                 | Subtracts source from destination  |
| `Minimum`         | `min(Src, Dst)`             | Per-channel minimum                |
| `Maximum`         | `max(Src, Dst)`             | Per-channel maximum                |

---

### Color Write Mask — `ColorMask`

```
ColorMask RGBA | RGB | R | G | B | A | RG | ...
```

Specifies which color channels are written to the render target. Provide any combination of the
characters `R`, `G`, `B`, and `A`.

| Example Value | Channels Written          |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| `RGBA`        | All channels (default)    |
| `RGB`         | Red, Green, Blue only     |
| `A`           | Alpha only                |
| `RBA`         | Red, Blue, Alpha          |

---

### Polygon Offset — `Offset`

```
Offset <factor> <units>
```

Applies a depth bias to rendered polygons to avoid z-fighting (e.g. decals rendered on top of
another surface).

| Parameter | Type  | Description                                                                  |
|-----------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `factor`  | float | Scales the maximum depth slope of the polygon                                |
| `units`   | float | Adds a constant depth offset in units of the smallest depth-buffer increment |

Example: `Offset -1 -1` pulls a surface slightly towards the camera.

---

### Alpha to Coverage — `AlphaToMask`

```
AlphaToMask On | Off
```

Enables alpha-to-coverage multisampling. The fragment alpha value is converted to a sample coverage
mask, producing anti-aliased transparency edges without sorting. Requires MSAA to be active.

| Value | Default |
|-------|---------|
| `Off` | ✓       |
| `On`  |         |

---

## Stencil Block

The `Stencil` block is a sub-block of a `Pass` that configures the stencil test. All commands
inside are optional; front- and back-face stencil operations can be configured independently.

The presence of a `Stencil` block enables the stencil test for the pass. Omit the block to leave
stencil testing disabled.

```
Stencil
{
    Ref       <int>
    ReadMask  <int>
    WriteMask <int>

    Comp      <StencilFunc>
    CompFront <StencilFunc>
    CompBack  <StencilFunc>

    Pass      <StencilOp>
    PassFront <StencilOp>
    PassBack  <StencilOp>

    Fail      <StencilOp>
    FailFront <StencilOp>
    FailBack  <StencilOp>

    ZFail      <StencilOp>
    ZFailFront <StencilOp>
    ZFailBack  <StencilOp>
}
```

Commands without a `Front`/`Back` suffix apply to both faces simultaneously.

### Reference & Mask Values

| Command     | Type | Description                                                             |
|-------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ref`       | int  | Reference value compared against the stencil buffer                    |
| `ReadMask`  | int  | Bitmask ANDed with both the reference and stored value before comparing |
| `WriteMask` | int  | Bitmask controlling which stencil bits are written                      |

### Stencil Comparison Functions

Used by `Comp`, `CompFront`, `CompBack`.

| Value          | Passes when…                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Never`        | Never                                   |
| `Less`         | `Ref & ReadMask < StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `Equal`        | `Ref & ReadMask = StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `LessEqual`    | `Ref & ReadMask ≤ StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `Greater`      | `Ref & ReadMask > StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `NotEqual`     | `Ref & ReadMask ≠ StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `GreaterEqual` | `Ref & ReadMask ≥ StencilValue & ReadMask` |
| `Always`       | Always                                  |

### Stencil Operations

Used by `Pass`/`PassFront`/`PassBack`, `Fail`/`FailFront`/`FailBack`, and
`ZFail`/`ZFailFront`/`ZFailBack`.

| Operation      | Trigger                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pass`         | Stencil test passed and depth test passed            |
| `Fail`         | Stencil test failed                                  |
| `ZFail`        | Stencil test passed but depth test failed            |

| Value                | Description                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Keep`               | Keep the current stencil value                              |
| `Zero`               | Set stencil value to 0                                      |
| `Replace`            | Replace with the `Ref` value                                |
| `IncrementAndClamp`  | Increment, clamping at the maximum value                    |
| `DecrementAndClamp`  | Decrement, clamping at 0                                    |
| `Invert`             | Bitwise invert                                              |
| `IncrementAndWrap`   | Increment, wrapping to 0 when past the maximum              |
| `DecrementAndWrap`   | Decrement, wrapping to the maximum value when below 0       |

## GLSLPROGRAM Block

Each pass must contain exactly one `GLSLPROGRAM ... ENDGLSL` block. Everything between the markers is
captured verbatim, the ShaderDef parser does not interpret it. The compiler reads it as a list of
sections:

```glsl
GLSLPROGRAM
Shared
{
    // prepended to every stage
}
Vertex
{
    in vec3 vertexPosition;
    out vec2 uv;
    void main() { ... }
}
Fragment
{
    in vec2 uv;
    out vec4 color;
    void main() { ... }
}
ENDGLSL
```

| Section    | Notes                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Shared`   | Optional. Prepended to every stage of the pass.                      |
| `Vertex`   | Required for a graphics pass.                                         |
| `Fragment` | Optional, a pass without one writes depth only.                       |
| `Compute`  | A compute pass, the only section besides `Shared`.                    |

| Element       | Required | Notes                                                    |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `GLSLPROGRAM` | Yes      | Opening marker. Case-sensitive, must be uppercase.       |
| `ENDGLSL`     | Yes      | Closing marker. Case-sensitive, must be uppercase.       |

The code is plain GLSL in the OpenGL style. The compiler adds `#version 460` (a `#version` in the
source is an error) and turns it into Vulkan GLSL:

* Loose uniforms of every stage (`uniform vec4 _Color;`) are gathered into one std140 uniform block,
  reflected as `$Global`, with the same layout in every stage.
* Textures, samplers, images, uniform blocks and buffer blocks get descriptor bindings by name, the same
  in every stage. Explicit `layout(set = S, binding = B)` qualifiers are kept.
* Varyings get locations by name, matched between the vertex and fragment stage. Vertex inputs and
  fragment outputs get locations in declaration order. Explicit locations are kept.
* `gl_VertexID` and `gl_InstanceID` are mapped to their Vulkan forms.
* `GRAPHITE_VERTEX`, `GRAPHITE_FRAGMENT` or `GRAPHITE_COMPUTE` is defined for the stage being compiled.

`#include "Name"` resolves `Graphite/...` from the compiler's built in library and anything else through
the host. `#pragma once` is supported.

Variant axes are declared with pragmas anywhere in the program or its includes:

```glsl
#pragma variant _NORMALMAP                 // toggle, defines _NORMALMAP when on
#pragma variant _SURFACE OPAQUE CUTOUT     // enum, defines _SURFACE_OPAQUE or _SURFACE_CUTOUT
#pragma variant global FOG OFF LINEAR EXP  // set by the renderer or a view, never by a material
```

Compile errors report `file:line`, where the file is the shader name (and pass name) and the line is the
line of the `.shader` document, or the include's own name and line.

---

## Fallback

```
Fallback "FallbackShaderName"
```

Optional. Names an alternative shader to use when this shader cannot run on the current hardware or
render pipeline.

Graphite parses and stores the name on `ShaderDefinition.Fallback` but never resolves it. Resolving
the name to another shader is up to the engine.

## Diagnostics

Parsing reports errors with the source line and column. The following conditions are rejected
rather than silently accepted:

### Structure

| Condition                                  | Message                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A `Pass` has no `GLSLPROGRAM` block        | `Each Pass must contain a GLSLPROGRAM block` |
| A `GLSLPROGRAM` block has no `ENDGLSL`      | `Unterminated GLSLPROGRAM block: missing closing 'ENDGLSL'` |
| A `Shader` declares no passes              | `Shader must contain at least one Pass`       |
| Content follows the shader's closing brace | `Unexpected content '...' after shader`       |

### Duplicates

Duplicate identifiers are errors; the diagnostic points at the second occurrence.

| Scope                              | Message                      |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Two tags share a key in one `Pass` | `Duplicate tag key '...'`    |
| Two properties share a name        | `Duplicate property '...'`   |
| Two passes share a `Name`          | `Duplicate pass name '...'`  |

Passes without a `Name` are never considered duplicates of one another.

### Commands

A render-state or `Stencil` command that is not recognized (for example a typo like `Culll`)
reports `Unknown command '...'` rather than failing later with a confusing message.

### Values

| Condition                                          | Message                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A number cannot be parsed (e.g. overflow, hex)     | `'...' is not a valid integer` / `number`     |
| A property default does not match its declared type| `<Type> property expects <shape>, but found '...'` |

> Because a `Vector` and a `Matrix` default both begin with `(`, supplying one where the other is
> expected is reported by the underlying value parser rather than as a property-shape mismatch.
